By *ranking** we refer here to the [statistical ranking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking), and in particular the factional ranking.

In the small program, we studied and implemented the algorithm of average ranking implemented in GNU-R. Given an array of `double` values, the program ranks them by the ascending order using the fractional ranking.

Such ranking results are important in statistical tests such as the [Mann-Whitney U Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U).
