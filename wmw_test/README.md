Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test allowing for correlation
============================================================

The wmw_test function uses data structure and functions defined in the rank module to perform a variant of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test which allows correlation.

The algorithm was first implemented by Gordon Smith and Di Wu in R.

Rmath library is required for compilation.
